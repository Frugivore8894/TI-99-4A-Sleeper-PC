This was opriginaly just going to be a semi detailed modle the TI-99 4A but I decided to redirect this repo to be a place where I'll be updating my progress of this Sleeper build. I'll be uploading any parts I design for it.

#Update One
This is a very closes but not perfect modle of a t-99 4A case. Parts should not be designed using only this modle but it will likly be a good way to visualized them. Take all mesurements with a grain of salt.
